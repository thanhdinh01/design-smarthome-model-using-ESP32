- A smart home is one in which appliances and devices can be controlled remotely from any phone or computer with an internet connection. The ESP32 microcontroller has on-board Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support, making it ideal for makers and electronics enthusiasts looking to build my team's smart home project.
- And this project is also my team's graduation thesis 🎓
